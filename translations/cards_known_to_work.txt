 Other: Works well with Ndiswrapper 1.0 and CDROM WinXP driver on Gentoo with Kernel 2.6.11. ASUS Downloaded driver fails.; Problems with new driver versions and ndiswrapper 1.x (System Freeze), but the driver on CD mrv8k51 (ASUS,12/24/2003,2.2.0.20) works fine with ndiswrapper 1.5 (1.6rc2 is more stable) on linux 2.6.14.2 and 16kstacks (I will test if it works without the 16k patch). Works better with win98 driver for the card D-Link DWL-G510 ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Wireless/dwlg510/Drivers/dwlg510_driver_100.zip (manual directory). 
 Other: Ubuntu Dapper comes with a native, but not working Marvell driver http://www.saillard.org/linux/mrv8k/. To use ndiswrapper, you must prevent it from loading at boot, e.g. by removing the mrv8k.ko file from /lib/modules/...kernel....  The DLink Win98 driver works, but I see a few system freezes.  Using the newer, downloaded Asus Win98 driver (after renaming mrv8ka50.sys to mrv8ka51.sys) the system often hangs at boot, but is more stable afterwards. With both drivers, booting is slow.
 Other: The above versions causes kernel freeze/panic on Ubuntu Edgy (Ndiswrapper module version 1.22, Kernel: 2.6.17-10-generic). A workaround is yet to be found...  
 Other: The 64-bit driver mentioned above - which doesn''t work with winxp sp2 on my box :) - works well on my 32-bit athlon and seems to be the only driver allowing WPA2 connection. (kernel: 2.6.19-gentoo-r4, ndiswrapper-1.34, wpa_supplicant-0.5.7)

 Driver: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloads1-3.aspx?Keyword=8180 (click on) ndis5x-8180(170).zip
 Other: This PCI card works with ndiswrapper v0.10 when you use RTL8080 driver, not Belkin driver. The PCIID of this card is different from Realtek driver''s supported PCIID, so you need to tell ndiswrapper to use realtek driver for 1799:6001. So execute "ndiswrapper -d 1799:6001 net8180". Now make sure ndiswrapper got it right by checking the output "ndiswrapper -l". It should print "net8180 driver present, hardware present".
 Other: Card also works using (173).zip driver, with Ndiswrapper 1.7 on 2.6.15-rc7 and 1.8 on 2.6.15 (with 4K stacks!) on a debian box.

 Other: Using Fedora 3 kernel-2.6.9-1.667.stk16.i586.  This PCI card works with ndiswrapper v0.12 when you use the Belkin driver supplied on CD with the card (probably also with the drivers available at http://www.belkin.com). The PCI card did not work with ndiswrapper v0.12 and the RTL8080 driver. Neither driver worked with ndiswrapper-1.0rc3. Just follow the standard ndiswrapper installation instructions.

 *Toshiba Satellite 4015CDT, Debian Sarge, kernel 2.6.8 / ndiswrapper 0.10. The Belkin driver did not work for me, it loaded but failed to do anything useful whatsoever. An ndiswrapper -l using the realtek driver reported the hardware not present. By copying the Bel6020.inf file from the Belkin driver and the rtl8180.sys file from the realtek driver into the same directory, and replacing every instance of the string "Bel6020.sys" with "rtl8180.sys" I was able to get the card work satisfactorily. "(Best Solution)''
 * Acer TravelMate 240 series. Follow the same procedure as in Toshiba Satellite above. Tested on debian unstable, 2.6.16-2-686 kernel with headers. I have compiled the ndiswrapper(1.6) module for the kernel from source, since apt-get did/does not install it.
 *Dell Latitude CPi, Debian Sarge, kernel 2.6.7 / Ndiswrapper 0.10-1. After first trying with the Belkin driver, fiddeling the mode back and forward between Ad-Hoc and Managed mode without much success I switched driver to the one from RealTek?. Which works without any trouble what so ever. 
 *Other: Dell Latitude C840, Mandrake 10, kernel 2.6.3-15mdk / Ndiswrapper 0.9. WEP works with non-broadcasting essid.  Managed mode requires several attempts to get activated. I have to toggle between the 2 modes (Ad-Hoc and Managed) to get the link LED on the PCMCIA card to lit up.
 *IBM Thinkpad T23, Debian testing, kernel 2.6.10, ndiswrapper 1.1rc1@050217 (nightly). Using the Debian packages did not work, so first get rid of packages ndiswrapper-source/utils/modules, then install the nightly build (both utils and driver of course). Then download the ndis-driver from realtek, and install with ndiswrapper -i. By some reason, the .conf-files in /etc/ndiswrapper/net8180/ will be called 10EC:8180.5.conf. Until I changed that into 1799:6020.5.conf (the PCIID you get from lspci -n), the hardware was not detected with ndiswrapper -l.  As I don''t have an AP, I cannot really verify that it works from here, but it looks promising.
 *IBM ThinkPad A22P. Tested on RHEL AS4 update 4 with ndiswrapper v. 1.9.  Download the driver ftp://210.51.181.211/cn/wlan/ndis5x-8180(173).zip and install according to the basic ndiswrapper instructions.  After installing, rename the files in /etc/ndiswrapper/net8180, substituting `10EC'' with `1799'' and `8180'' with `6020'', respectively, to match the PCIID you get from `lspci -n''.

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000)
 Chipset: BCM4306 Board: V1799 D-7000 Rev 4.5
 pciid: 14e4:4320
 Driver: http://www.belkin.com
 Other: This is PCI, not cardbus. The chipset is marked BCM4306, however the supplied utility in win98 detects "BCM4306/BCM2050", and Linux utilities have variously reported; BCM4306, BCM4320, BCM94306. This card has been stable on a Slackware SMP system with ndiswrapper-0.8 since released, versions 0.7 and 0.9 do not work with the SMP kernel.

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000) Rev 02
 Chipset: BCM94306
 Driver: From Installation CD
 Other: It is working on Slackware 10 (kernel 2.4.25 and kernel 2.6.8.1) Also working on Gentoo (using various 2.6.x kernels), however from ndiswrapper > 0.8 the Belkin drivers did not work at all (Oops at modprobe, system lockup); I used the Dell drivers (see the rev 03 entry following this one) instead, and now I''m happily running 0.11.

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000) Rev 02

 Other: Ndiswrapper 1.2 on Debian Sarge running Kernel version 2.6.8-2-686

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000) Rev 03
 Chipset: BCM4306
 pciid: 14e4:4320
 Driver: http://ftp.us.dell.com/network/R81433.EXE (use bcmwl5a.inf in directory AR)
 Other: I tried to use the belkin driver (bcmwl5.inf) but the whole system just locked up as soon as I modprobed ndiswrapper. Apparently the belkin driver works for the older rev 02 cards, but not rev 03. So I''m suggesting this for folks with the Rev 03 card. You can check the revision by doing a "lspci" The Dell driver has been working great for me, for about a day.
 Other: The rev.03 problem is probably not all that sinister. It is caused by the presence of the NetworkType|0 line which ends up in the*.conf files (from the *.inf driver file).  Removing this allows the supplied Belkin driver to work, although I''d probably recommend using the Dell R81433.exe driver anyway if only because it''s a later version. For non-US users you may wish to edit the Channel parameter to be 13 (Europe) (or 14 in Japan?). Applies to both PCMCIA and PCI versions (F5D7000 and F5D7010).

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless G Desktop Card (F5D7000) (Version 5100)
 Chipset: Atheros AR5005G NIC (Rev 01)
 Driver: Standard Belkin Driver that came with the Installation CD
 Other: Installed on Suse Linux 10.1 with ndiswrapper 1.10-19 (the version that came with Suse Linux 10.1) - installed with instructions from this link: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Suse_Professional_9.2

 Other: 10/29/2005 - added this entry because Belkin is now using this Broadcom chipset and not the rt2500 anymore.  A pity as the rt2500 has awesome native linux drivers.  Ndiswrapper works beautifully on my Slack 10.2 desktop with 2.6.13 kernel.

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless G Desktop Card (F5D7000) Rev5000

 Card: Belkin 54g Wireless Desktop Network Card (F5D7000UK)
 Chipset:
 pciid:
 Driver: Standard belkin driver
 Other: Just added this so that people know that the UK variation can be used. I used the standard belkin driver, but you need to install it to somewhere in windows to extract the relevant sys and inf files. Works like a charm with fedora core 2 and fedora core 3 (though with fc3 you will need to download the kernel source rpm as it doesn''t come with the standard package).
 Other:Finally works on my system (the card says "version 1133uk", Debian woody, kernel 2.4.28, ndiswrapper 0.11, Dell drivers, hand-compiled wirless-tools v27). Here are a few hints if you''re having trouble: (i) try different combinations of ndiswrapper version and driver (Belkin, Dell). (ii) make sure wireless extension version of your wireless-tools matches the one of ndiswrapper (Debian woody wireless-tools were too old, iwconfig wouldn''t work), see http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.htm for more information. (iii) wireless won''t work if your machine also has another network card connected to the same network.

 Other: Debian stable Sarge (2.4.27-2-386) works a treat. I followed the "InstallDebianSarge" instructions which were great. In the end however, I didn''t need the "Install latest Ndiswrapper" section as version 1.1 comes already available. Also, needed unzip utility (apt-get install unzip). Cheers!.

 Other: The card is working however I am not sure about the advertised speeds. I will update later. Used ndiswrapper on a Fedora Core 2 distro. Dell driver worked better than the Belkin CD. It works on Suse Linux 10.1 with the cd, without problem and with advanced speed, however if you use dell driver it keeps disconnecting!

 Installation : Install most current ndiswrapper and dkms for you *nix system as of this writing This card is working in mandriva and fedora. You will have to try it on your distribution of *nix. You have to unzip the driver into a directory you can access. There will be 3 files net8185.inf net8185.sys net8185.cat. Open a terminal and change to user root with su and root password, then type ndiswrapper -i net8185.inf in the folder where you extracted the driver files hit enter. next ndiswrapper -l shows net8185 driver installed we now have to get the device id from root prompt type lspci -n at the bottom of the list is the belkin card card ID info 1799:701f write this down you will need it for the next portion of the installation. Now from root prompt type ndiswrapper -a 1799:701f net8185 hit enter this associates the net8185 driver with the device ID of the belkin card. from root ndiswrapper -l should now show&lt;br>net8185 : driver installed&lt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device (1799:701f) present&lt;br>
 from root prompt type modprobe ndiswrapper it will pause for a moment and then the lights on the card should come on. Once the card is running from root prompt type ndiswrapper -m to install an alias for you so the card will activate on boot. Card pulled an ip my mandriva server and associated with the linksys router running dd-wrt 23sp2. On Fedora: As soon as the card is recognized it and the ndiswrapper kernel module loads fine, run 
 ndiswrapper -m (as root). Then add the line alias wlan0 ndiswrapper to /etc/modprobe.conf. After this you can now go to configure it by running the "Network" program from system settings (or just run system-config-network). Select "New" > "Wireless connection". The card should show up like "wlan0 (ndiswrapper)". Proceed with the rest of the settings. If you want, you can check here to activate it at boot time. Note: If you are using a WEP key in hexadecimal format (numbers and letters from A to F) make sure you proceed it with a 0x when prompted.

 * Other: Using Ndiswrapper 1.5 and the above driver with no problems. Suse 10 requires some extra help though with this wlan card. In order to work with Suse 10 x86_64, install ndiswrapper and driver then run modprobe ndiswrapper. After that, use Yast to add new network card. Select Device Type = Wireless, Configuration Name = wlan0 (or wlanX where X is the next wireless card number), Hardware Configuration Name = bus-pci-0000:XX:XX.X (replace the X''s with the pci location of the device from the output of "lspci -v'') &ndash; for example, my lspci -v returned ":03:02.0'' before my BCM4318 card, therefore my Configuration Name is "pci-bus-0000:03:02.0'', Module Name = ndiswrapper, and lastly in Options, put irq=XX where XX is the IRQ number also returned in the output from lspci -v. Click Next and then enter the AP Name and key information if this applies to you. After you finish that and finish the configuration, restart and press F2 at the Suse 10 boot menu. VERY IMPORTANT** Add the boot option of "noapic'' (NOT "noacpi'') and continue to boot. This option is required for Suse 10 x86_64 to see and use the BCM4318 card. Hope this helps!

 In my particular scenario, using SUSE 10.2, the wireless device was already detected which really threw me. To get ndiswrapper working, make sure GCC and the kernel source is installed. Do this by opening Yast, click on Software Management and search for each, click the check box to install and accept. It will most likely require you to insert the disk to install the libraries. Then open xTerminal and  cd to the directory in which ndiswrapper is present. Follow the directions that came with ndiswrapper. */ Important */ From here go into the network configuration, do these steps if the wireless card is already present. 1. Click on the device and click Edit. 2. Click Advanced and hardware details. 3. Change module to: ndiswrapper. After fulfilling these steps restart the computer and type noapic at boot options. If you need any help feel free to email me at compnet32@gmail.com Hope it all works!

 Driver ndiswrapper-1.2-3mdk . Works with Broadcom Wireless LAN Driver Release Date: 2005-06-01, Version: 4.00 C from hp website. WPA has not been tested. iwconfig should display a Signal Strength between -15 dB and -90 dB. Issue found : nothing critical. Turning on or off the radio with the button has no effect on wlan (but has on bluetooth). You sometimes have to wait up to 30s after receiving the signal to get a MAC and IP address with some wireless receivers. Playing too much and too fast with rmmod and modprobe can hang the laptop. It looks like the integrated network card shouldn''t be in the same range than the wireless device (strange), but would require more testing.

 Card: Buffalo AirStation G54 (WLI2-CB-G54L)
 Vendor: Linksys, A Division of Cisco Systems
 Description:  AirConn INPROCOMM IPN 2220 Wireless LAN Adapter (rev 01) PCI ID: 17FE:2220
 Driver: ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/notebook/TravelMate_4000_4500/driver/a802.zip, Kernel:2.6.11-6mdk, ndiswrapper: 1.1
 Notes: Despite the driver coming from the acer website it appears this is a generic driver for this chipset. The drivers from the CD that came with the card would not work, nor would those downloaded from the Buffalo website.
 Notes: On Ubuntu Breezy Badger iwconfig doesn''t work some reason manage to get to set the key for the access point. Due to that the connection won''t work, even though WPA isn''t used. More information in http://www.wi-fitechnology.com/viewthread25.html a forum post (note that the file to edit is /etc/network/interfaces on Ubuntu).
 Notes: On Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake) the above problem seems to have been resolved; however, for some reason iwconfig releases the settings made to it (essid & key, or just essid or just key), perhaps if the wireless connection goes down for extended periods of time.

 Card: Buffalo Tech WLI2-PCI-G54
 Chipset: Buffalo BCM94306 (rev 03)
 pciid: 14e4:4320
 Driver: ftp://ftp.dell.com/network/R81433.EXE
 Other: Use the .inf in the AR directory. Works with ndiswrappers 0.11 and RHEL 3.
 Other: In order to install the drivers you need to first blacklist the bcm43xx driver with the command: echo "blacklist bcm43xx'' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist . Then install the bcmwl5.inf file. Check this guide for more info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1699599
 Other: Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary), ndiswrapper 1.0rc2, dell drivers from file R81433.EXE.  I used the bcmwl5, not bcmwl5a drivers in the AR directory, not sure of the difference.  No luck until I editted *every* .conf file in /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5/, replacing RadioState|1 with RadioState|0.  Now it appears to be working perfectly on an open network.

 Chipset: Prism GT USB
 usbid: 2001:3701
 Driver: Driver available online . Driver version 04/2004, 1.00.15 (branded as a Conexant driver; D-Link''s drivers are older and less stable).
 Other: Works with WEP. Linux 2.6.10 ndiswrapper-1.5 has made this card extremely stable.
 Other: I had major stability problems with all drivers available on the US D-Link site. The drivers available there are "10/04/2003, 0.10.0.2" (labeled as v1.10) and "11/11/2003, 1.00.5.0" (labeled as v1.12). I discovered that there are several other drivers available on D-Link''s other regional sites, with conflicting version labels. I located the "04/06/2004, 1.00.15.0" driver on the Australian site labeled as v2.00. (The driver labeled v1.15 there was actually the 1.00.5.0 driver). The most recent driver that I could find was on the Taiwan site, which is "08/05/2004, 3.00.22.0" and labeled as v3.00 for rev C1 hardware. The 3.00.22.0 driver seems to be backward compatible with my rev B1 hardware and is working ok, but I have not been using it long enough yet to determine how stable it is.

 Driver: 04/01/2004 1.00.00.0000 from the CD works with ndiswrapper-1.1 The older(?) driver from binbash.de made problems after insmodding ndiswrapper in the kernel (see below). I am running Gentoo Linux with kernel 2.6.11-r6. The driver works with WPA-PKS (TKIP)
 Other: Using kernel 2.6.10-1.770_14.rhfc3.at, can hang initial modprobe if the dongle is plugged in, unplug it to get past problem. This version of the dongle is rt2500 based and NOT prism based (USA dlink site has wrong drivers!)

 Other: Works with WEP and WPA with TKIP cipher. May need iwpriv wlan0 ndis_reset when changing essid.
 Other: Dlink driver has worked fairly stable on ndiswrapper 1.2 but is rock solid on ndiswrapper 1.5, at least for me. This was tested on Arch Linux, kernel 2.6.11 up to 2.6.14, SMP, PREEMPT, Pentium3, default stack settings. ndiswrapper 1.4 OOPses and locks hard, unstable, even with uniprocessor kernel. Only WEP was tested.
 Other: I use this card under ndiswrapper 1.2 on a gentoo 2.6.12 kernel without problem. See http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=482&highlight=link this thread. One thing: if the network goes down, rmmod ndiswrapper FAST and reinsert it to prevent a kernel panic. Only tested with 1.2.

 Other: D-Link-provided drivers give huge system lags, system stops responding for full seconds at a time. The Realtek driver works well, but to make the driver recognize the card you must manually edit the file NET8180.INF and change all references to the pci-id 10ec:8180 into 1186:3300. Note that you much change 8180 to 3300 only when it appears near or next to 10ec, and leave it otherwise. See http://www.samwel.tk/bart/various/dwl-510-on-linux-2.6.html.
 Comment: There is not allways a true! I use D-Link drivers, and they works fine for me, better than Realtek drivers.

 Other: SUSE 9.2 Ndiswrapper 0.10-3. Works fine also with 128 bit WEP. Installed Ndiswrapper that ships with SUSE 9.2. Add Dlink Driver with "ndiswrapper -i GPLUS.inf" Add "alias wlan0 ndiswrapper" to /etc/modprobe.conf.local. Load driver for the first time with "modprobe ndiswrapper." Plug in the card. Configure it with YAST. Be sure that in YAST networkcard setup at Advanced&rarr;Hardware Details the module is set to ndiswrapper. Since SUSE 9.2 ships with native linux acx-111 driver you might get the wrong driver loaded.  The linux acx-111 driver lacks support for WEP. Have to replug the card after a suspend to disk. Thanks for ndiswrapper.  Other:Also works with SUSE 9.3. See the readme file /usr/share/doc/packages/ndiswrapper/README.SUSE. No more replug after suspend to disk required. Also got WPA working. Only problem was that there is a typo in the script /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-wireless-wpa ! Correct the typo in line 188 "WPA_DRIVER=ndiswrapper" !
 Troubleshooting: I used the new driver version 3.10 from www.dlink.de.  After "unshield data1.cab'' and "ndiswrapper -i GPLUS.inf'' I had an invalid driver message on "ndiswrapper -l''.  But then I "cp GPLUS.sys GPLUS_XP.sys /etc/ndiswrapper/gplus'', it works fine.

 Card: D-Link WUA-2340(USB)
 Chipset: Unknown (Atheros?)
 usbid: 07d1:3a07
 Driver: Driver available on accompanying CD and on www.dlink.com.  Installed on WinXP machine to get access to drivers in windows/inf folder, and program files/D-Link folder.  (I added both oem47.inf, athfmwdl.sys, ar5523.bin, and oem48.inf, a5agu.sys, ar5523.bin) EDIT: Worked only when: Used with ndiswrapper version 1.30; Used D-link driver version 101 with NetA5AGU.inf, this .inf file is the only driver file needed.
 Other: Able to recognize hardware (ndiswrapper -l showed hardware pressent) using same procedure as for the DWL-1340, but on loading the kernal module, wlan0 appeared but was not configurable and did not respond to ifdown/ifup, so I couldn''t get this device to work with ndiswrapper. EDIT: This device was able to work with ndiswapper version 1.30 and NetA5AGU.inf from D-link website
 Success: Though others above have had success with ndiswrapper version 1.30, I was unable to compile this old version against my kernel sources (2.6.22-suspend2-r2) due to a change in some kernel macro specs. Later versions of ndiswrapper would compile, install drivers, modprobe properly, but... nothing happened. No dmesg errors, but no dmesg output about loading drivers either, even though ndiswrapper -l showed the drivers there, and the hardware present. This has been fixed in ndiswrapper 1.49, which works perfectly with the neta5agu.inf driver (version 1.20). The wlan0 interface is initialized on my laptop, and by issuing a "ln -s /etc/init.d/net.lo /etc/init.d/net.wlan" followed by a "/etc/init.d/net.wlan start" my already-installed wpa_supplicant sprang into action and connected me to my WPA-PSK protected router. Can''t ask for more.

 Other: Debian Unstable/Sid with NdisWrapper 0.11.  You must install all three inf files from the driver zip file (I had to force NDIS to load all three drivers for the one card with the -d option on each inf). Card works great, but WEP is untested. Works great on Slackware 10.1 with a 2.6.10 kernel, and Ubuntu Breezy using the latest version of NdisWrapper.
 Fedora Core 5, Kernel 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5, works fine with ndiswrapper 1.13, I only needed the LSIPNDS.INF file.  I added the line ""alias wlan0 ndiswrapper"" to the /etc/modprobe.conf file so that the network configuration gui would pick it up.  Once I applied DNS, IP, Gate, Mask, ESSID, I was running wide open.  These are good inexpensive cards at any WalMart in USA.

 Driver version: 4.100.15.5
 Fedora Core 6, x86-64, kernel 2.6.18-1.2849.fc6-x86_64
 ndiswrapper: ndiswrapper-1.31.  1.28rc2 works also
 Note: other Broadcom draft n drivers, such as the Dell and others do not work.  They appear to support a device 14e4:4328 but not 4329.  Only the newest Linksys driver supports 64 bit.  Previous one did not.  According to iwconfig, getting speeds in the 200 Mbit/s range, even with tx power turned down to 10dBm. 
 As far as I can tell, draft N actually works.
 "This version of the driver also fixes a rootkit exploit'' see: http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=365
 For older BCM cards, the file bcmwl5.inf does not contain the required data although I suspect the drivers themselves do.  Other manufacturers such as Dell have released updated drivers fixing the vulnerability. See: http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd&releaseid=R140746&SystemID=INS_PNT_P4_9400&os=WXPX&osl=en&deviceid=9805&devlib=0&typecnt=1&vercnt=2&formatcnt=1&libid=5&fileid=187886 which does not include information for 14e4:4329 however.

 Driver version: 6.0.1.4
 OpenSuSE 10.2
 ndiswrapper 1.29 (1.34 does not work - locks up the machine)
 Note: If you use the Linksys drivers then it seems to lose connections after a short time or on large downloads. Replace the ar5416.sys with the one from the Belkin drivers and this does not happen. The only change I made to net5416.inf was to update the version number.
 Note: This doesn''t work for Fedora 6 kernel 2.6.19 with ndiswrapper 1.25 (built in), 1.29 as above, 1.36, 1.37 or 1.38.  The first modprobe works ok, and even allows connection, but you cannot modprobe a second time - each time it maxes the CPU or crashes the kernel.  Same symptoms with a 16k stack sized kernel.

 Driver 0: Native GPL Ralink driver in Ubuntu Breezy (rt2500 and rt2500-source packages). Installed the source and manually built with "make''. Then used Gnome''s network configuration to setup the device. Seems to perform as well as Windows version, but haven''t tried WEP or WPA. My card was labeled WMP54G (EU), bought in 11/2005.
 Driver 1: RT2500.inf from the WMP54Gv4 directory on the CD (the bundled CD has both v2 and v4 drivers), or download the drivers straight from Linksys.
 Other: Debian Sarge, 2.4 kernel, and 128-bit WEP.  Works great. Also works with Mandrake 10.1 with the newest versions of Ndiswrapper, not the one included on the installation CD. Note that Ralink has provided the source for an official driver at http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm but I have not tested it yet.

 Driver: Don''t use driver that ships with card, it didnt work with ndiswrapper. Use the close source driver from Ralink http://www.ralinktech.com. It compiles for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
 Other: The rt2x00 Open Source Project (http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com) have now a driver - but realy beta.
 Other: The Ralink driver works great. It is not a plug and play, you need your kernel headers, the appropiate gcc (3.4) but when you can link it together and put it where it loads at startup, it works great. I am using WPA without any problem.

 Other: linux-2.6.8-gentoo kernel, ndiswrapper 0.10.Kept having kernel panic (interrupt-related) upon module load until I set CONFIG_PCI_MSI=y (and unset CONFIG_4KSTACKS, just in case.) Also, used "ndiswrapper -i LSTINDS.INF" (NOT lsbcmnds.inf).  Works with 64 and 128-bit WEP. Sometimes need to repeat config info (and commit) repeatedly, else driver & card will ignore requested setup. Also works with Gentoo 2.6.9-r9, ndiswrapper 0.12 and drivers that came from CD. 
 Other: Working fine on Ubuntu Breezy Badger (kernel 2.6.12) using ndiswrapper 1.9 / ndiswrapper-utils 1.7 and lstinds.inf driver.
 Other: Ndiswrapper is not needed. In Ubuntu Dapper (and probably in other Linux distributions as well) this card is supported natively with the acx driver.  See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75448

 This driver works with WPA (wpa supplicant - use "wext" instead of "ndiswrapper" as driver-parameter like this: "wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext -B") tested on a OpenSuse 10.3 System.
 Other: The ridiculous URL above appears to be the only way to get at the official driver, since there''s nothing obvious at the Linksys ftp site. Unpack WPC54Gv5.zip, then &lt;tt>ndiswrapper -i LSMVNDS.inf&lt;/tt>. I used FC3, kernel 2.6.12-1.1381_FC3 unmodified (despite the 4K page warning). There''s an UNIMPLEMENTED warning which looks serious, but from the mailing list archive can apparently be ignored. AP is Linksys

 Other: Ndiswrapper 0.10rc1 Manual compile. Works fine. Also reports speed up to 125Mb/s. Suspend/Rsume also works great. Great card, hassle freee install.
 Other: Ndiswrapper 1.9 manual compile on SuSE 9.0, kernel 2.4.32 (ix86). Have found more recent versions of ndiswrapper would compile but fail to load the module with an unresolved symbol error. Works great with the driver mentioned above together with WRT54G router and wpa_supplicant 0.4.6 (rpm binary)., with WPA enabled ("WPA Enterprise"-mode). Still I was not successful to get the card to authenticate with the router set to "WPA2 Enterprise"-mode. For SuSE 9.0 you will need to manually add libhistory.so.5 and libreadline.so.5 to your system in order to meet the requirements for wpa_supplicant (e.g. extract them from the readline-5.0-1.2.i586.rpm )

 Other: Works smoothly, of course ;) - this is the device the USB extension was originally developed for. WEP is running, WPA is supported using wpa_supplicant 0.2.5. No problems with both 1.1 and 2.0 host controllers. As with many other USB devices, no success with 2.4 kernels so far. Try to use 2.6.7 or better. There is a native driver for Prism54 that is working on USB support. View its status at Prism54.org
 Other: Works with latest Windows Driver from linksys.com. No success with 2.4 kernels (even with 8k stack). Works with kernel 2.6.11 and 2.6.12. Works smoothly with 2.6.12 and ndiswrapper 1.14.

WEP works with 64bit and 128bit keys. but bitrate is only 11Mbit/s Note: rename the configuration file for the adapter once you  installed the drivers (getting them extracted is quite a mess (WINE/Cedega) you need rt2500usb.*). "mv /etc/ndiswrapper/rt2500usb/148F\:2570.0.conf /etc/ndiswrapper/rt2500usb/13b1\:000d.0.conf'' should do the trick.

 Card: Linksys WUSB54GSv1, 802.11b/g, USB 2.0
 Chipset: Broadcom - BCM4320?????
 usbid: 13b1:000e
 Driver: For 32bit versions, follow instructions for v2 below, replacing the device id 13b1:0014 with 13b1:000e
 Driver: For 64bit versions: get the usb8023.sys and rndismp.sys from a Windows XP / Vista 64bit installation. Also make sure you have the latest SVN version (or 1.20+). If you use this in combination with the .inf file from the official drivers as found on the LinkSys Support-site, it all works (even WEP and WPA)

 Card: Linksys WUSB54GSv2, 802.11b/g, USB 2.0
 Chipset: Broadcom - BCM4320SKFBG
 usbid: 13b1:0014
 Driver: You can install this driver by either of the following two methods.
 *Method1: The driver for this RNDIS card doesn''t include two .sys files required (usb8023k.sys and rndismpk.sys or usb8023x.sys and rndismpx.sys), as they are part of Windows installation and don''t need to be installed in Windows. However, other drivers for different cards based on RNDIS include these .sys files. One is Belkin F5D7051uk at http://www.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?download=1871&lang=1. You can install this driver with BCMRNDIS.INF, then, copy sys files with "cp USB8023K.sys /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmrndis/usb8023k.sys; cp RNDISMPK.SYS /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmrndis/rndismpk.sys''. You then need to inform ndiswrapper that this driver, bcmrndis, should be used for usbid of WUSB54GSv2 (13b1:0014), by executing "ndiswrapper -d 13b1:0014 bcmrndis''
 *Method2: Used the inf file from the CD, and the .SYS files from usr5420 available at www.usr.com http://www.usr-emea.com/support/s-prod-template.asp?loc=unkg&prod=5420. Used snapshot from 13/02/2006, along with the usr system files that i had to install on a windows machine to extract. Then copied the wusb54gs.inf and wusb54gsv2.inf to the folder with the sys files - the wusb54gs.inf worked seamlessly with my device on the snapshot.!
 With 2.6.16 kernels and later, you also need to configure udev; see entry for USR5421 below for details.

Copied the win files (usb8023.sys and rndismp.sys) from the F5D7051.exe http://www.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?download=1871&lang=1 download to the /etc/ndiswrapper/wusb54gsc/ folder.  Lastly, use the script detailed http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=225206 here , modidifed with the correct USB ProdID (0026), to get the power working.  It''s in the section "Getting WUSB54GS to Work in Edgy and Feisty''  Also check out the thread http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=2559643 here for why the script is needed and works.
 Other: With 2.6.16 and later kernels, RNDIS devices are not initialized (when device is plugged in, nothing happens). To get it going, you need to set the variable bConfigurationValue in sysfs. An easy way to do this is to add this: BUS==âusbâ, SYSFS{idProduct}==â0026â, SYSFS{idVendor}==â13b1â, PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/%p/device/bConfigurationValue''" to /etc/udev/rules.d/&lt;ruleFilename> file and restart udev. For FC6 &lt;ruleFilename> is 50-udev.rules.

I have not checked if this driver is the same as the one in the seperate WUSB54GPv1 driver release; I just know it works.  Also, i had to blacklist the islsm modules (www.prism54.org) that ship with Ubuntu.

 Fedora Core 5, Kernel 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5, works fine with ndiswrapper 1.13, I only needed the LSIPNDS.INF file.  I added the line ""alias wlan0 ndiswrapper"" to the /etc/modprobe.conf file so that the network configuration gui would pick it up.  Once I applied DNS, IP, Gate, Mask, ESSID, I was running wide open.  These are good inexpensive cards at any WalMart in USA.

 pciid: 14e4:4329, reported by lspci as Broadcom BCM43XG Rev. 1, but according to bcmwl5.inf, it should be BCM43XNG
 Driver: Linksys WMP300N_20061117_dr.exe
 Driver version: 4.100.15.5
 Fedora Core 6, x86-64, kernel 2.6.18-1.2849.fc6-x86_64
 ndiswrapper: ndiswrapper-1.31.  1.28rc2 works also
 Note: other Broadcom draft n drivers, such as the Dell and others do not work.  They appear to support a device 14e4:4328 but not 4329.  Only the newest Linksys driver supports 64 bit.  Previous one did not.  According to iwconfig, getting speeds in the 200 Mbit/s range, even with tx power turned down to 10dBm. 
 As far as I can tell, draft N actually works.
 "This version of the driver also fixes a rootkit exploit'' see: http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=365
 For older BCM cards, the file bcmwl5.inf does not contain the required data although I suspect the drivers themselves do.  Other manufacturers such as Dell have released updated drivers fixing the vulnerability. See: http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd&releaseid=R140746&SystemID=INS_PNT_P4_9400&os=WXPX&osl=en&deviceid=9805&devlib=0&typecnt=1&vercnt=2&formatcnt=1&libid=5&fileid=187886 which does not include information for 14e4:4329 however.

 Chipset: Atheros 5416
 pciid: 168c:0023
 Driver: Belkin F5D8001 (just the ar5416.sys file). Rest, standard Linksys install CD
 Driver version: 6.0.1.4
 OpenSuSE 10.2
 ndiswrapper 1.29 (1.34 does not work - locks up the machine)
 Note: If you use the Linksys drivers then it seems to lose connections after a short time or on large downloads. Replace the ar5416.sys with the one from the Belkin drivers and this does not happen. The only change I made to net5416.inf was to update the version number.
 Note: This doesn''t work for Fedora 6 kernel 2.6.19 with ndiswrapper 1.25 (built in), 1.29 as above, 1.36, 1.37 or 1.38.  The first modprobe works ok, and even allows connection, but you cannot modprobe a second time - each time it maxes the CPU or crashes the kernel.  Same symptoms with a 16k stack sized kernel.

 Driver: The current Linksys driver ftp://ftp.linksys.com/pub/network/WMP54Gv4_20040415.exe does work well with Ndiswrapper 1.0rc1. Use the driver in WMP54Gv4_20040415/Drivers/WMP54Gv2/bcmwl5.inf.
 Other: Debian Sarge, linux kernel 2.6.9, SMP, Ndiswrapper 1.0rc1 manual compile. WPA works with wpa_supplicant supplied with Debian (0.2.5), both broadcast and non-broadcast ssid.

 Card: Linksys WMP54G v4, 54mbps
 Chipset: Ralink RT2500
 pciid: 1814:0201
 Driver 0: Native GPL Ralink driver in Ubuntu Breezy (rt2500 and rt2500-source packages). Installed the source and manually built with "make''. Then used Gnome''s network configuration to setup the device. Seems to perform as well as Windows version, but haven''t tried WEP or WPA. My card was labeled WMP54G (EU), bought in 11/2005.
 Driver 1: RT2500.inf from the WMP54Gv4 directory on the CD (the bundled CD has both v2 and v4 drivers), or download the drivers straight from Linksys.
 Other: Debian Sarge, 2.4 kernel, and 128-bit WEP.  Works great. Also works with Mandrake 10.1 with the newest versions of Ndiswrapper, not the one included on the installation CD. Note that Ralink has provided the source for an official driver at http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm but I have not tested it yet.
 Driver 2: Open source driver of Ralink (serialmonkey) downloadable at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rt2400/rt2500-1.1.0-b4.tar.gz?download. Tested with WPA

 Card: Linksys WMP54G v4.1, 54mbps
 Chipset: Ralink RT61
 pciid: 1814:0301 and 1814:0302
 Driver: Don''t use driver that ships with card, it didnt work with ndiswrapper. Use the close source driver from Ralink http://www.ralinktech.com. It compiles for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
 Other: The rt2x00 Open Source Project (http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com) have now a driver - but realy beta.
 Other: The Ralink driver works great. It is not a plug and play, you need your kernel headers, the appropiate gcc (3.4) but when you can link it together and put it where it loads at startup, it works great. I am using WPA without any problem.

Also, used "ndiswrapper -i LSTINDS.INF" (NOT lsbcmnds.inf).  Works with 64 and 128-bit WEP. Sometimes need to repeat config info (and commit) repeatedly, else driver & card will ignore requested setup. Also works with Gentoo 2.6.9-r9, ndiswrapper 0.12 and drivers that came from CD. 
 Other: Working fine on Ubuntu Breezy Badger (kernel 2.6.12) using ndiswrapper 1.9 / ndiswrapper-utils 1.7 and lstinds.inf driver.
 Other: Ndiswrapper is not needed. In Ubuntu Dapper (and probably in other Linux distributions as well) this card is supported natively with the acx driver.  See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75448

 This driver works with WPA (wpa supplicant - use "wext" instead of "ndiswrapper" as driver-parameter like this: "wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext -B") tested on a OpenSuse 10.3 System.
 Other: The ridiculous URL above appears to be the only way to get at the official driver, since there''s nothing obvious at the Linksys ftp site. Unpack WPC54Gv5.zip, then &lt;tt>ndiswrapper -i LSMVNDS.inf&lt;/tt>. I used FC3, kernel 2.6.12-1.1381_FC3 unmodified (despite the 4K page warning). There''s an UNIMPLEMENTED warning which looks serious, but from the mailing list archive can apparently be ignored. AP is Linksys

 Other: Ndiswrapper 0.10rc1 Manual compile. Works fine. Also reports speed up to 125Mb/s. Suspend/Rsume also works great. Great card, hassle freee install.
 Other: Ndiswrapper 1.9 manual compile on SuSE 9.0, kernel 2.4.32 (ix86). Have found more recent versions of ndiswrapper would compile but fail to load the module with an unresolved symbol error. Works great with the driver mentioned above together with WRT54G router and wpa_supplicant 0.4.6 (rpm binary)., with WPA enabled ("WPA Enterprise"-mode). Still I was not successful to get the card to authenticate with the router set to "WPA2 Enterprise"-mode. For SuSE 9.0 you will need to manually add libhistory.so.5 and libreadline.so.5 to your system in order to meet the requirements for wpa_supplicant (e.g. extract them from the readline-5.0-1.2.i586.rpm )

No problems with both 1.1 and 2.0 host controllers. As with many other USB devices, no success with 2.4 kernels so far. Try to use 2.6.7 or better.

WEP works with 64bit and 128bit keys. but bitrate is only 11Mbit/s Note: rename the configuration file for the adapter once you  installed the drivers (getting them extracted is quite a mess (WINE/Cedega) you need rt2500usb.*). "mv /etc/ndiswrapper/rt2500usb/148F\:2570.0.conf /etc/ndiswrapper/rt2500usb/13b1\:000d.0.conf'' should do the trick.

 Card: Linksys WUSB54GSv1, 802.11b/g, USB 2.0

 usbid: 13b1:000e
 Driver: For 32bit versions, follow instructions for v2 below, replacing the device id 13b1:0014 with 13b1:000e
 Driver: For 64bit versions: get the usb8023.sys and rndismp.sys from a Windows XP / Vista 64bit installation. Also make sure you have the latest SVN version (or 1.20+). If you use this in combination with the .inf file from the official drivers as found on the LinkSys Support-site, it all works (even WEP and WPA)

 Card: Linksys WUSB54GSv2, 802.11b/g, USB 2.0
 Chipset: Broadcom - BCM4320SKFBG
 usbid: 13b1:0014
 Driver: You can install this driver by either of the following two methods.
 *Method1: The driver for this RNDIS card doesn''t include two .sys files required (usb8023k.sys and rndismpk.sys or usb8023x.sys and rndismpx.sys), as they are part of Windows installation and don''t need to be installed in Windows. However, other drivers for different cards based on RNDIS include these .sys files. One is Belkin F5D7051uk at http://www.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?download=1871&lang=1. You can install this driver with BCMRNDIS.INF, then, copy sys files with "cp USB8023K.sys /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmrndis/usb8023k.sys; cp RNDISMPK.SYS /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmrndis/rndismpk.sys''. You then need to inform ndiswrapper that this driver, bcmrndis, should be used for usbid of WUSB54GSv2 (13b1:0014), by executing "ndiswrapper -d 13b1:0014 bcmrndis''
 *Method2: Used the inf file from the CD, and the .SYS files from usr5420 available at www.usr.com http://www.usr-emea.com/support/s-prod-template.asp?loc=unkg&prod=5420. Used snapshot from 13/02/2006, along with the usr system files that i had to install on a windows machine to extract. Then copied the wusb54gs.inf and wusb54gsv2.inf to the folder with the sys files - the wusb54gs.inf worked seamlessly with my device on the snapshot.!
 With 2.6.16 kernels and later, you also need to configure udev; see entry for USR5421 below for details.

 Card: Linksys WUSB54GSC, 802.11b/g, USB 2.0
 Chipset: Broadcom

 Driver: Downloaded driver http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417109934&packedargs=sku%3D1154470123093&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper here and install.  Copied the win files (usb8023.sys and rndismp.sys) from the F5D7051.exe http://www.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?download=1871&lang=1 download to the /etc/ndiswrapper/wusb54gsc/ folder.  Lastly, use the script detailed http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=225206 here , modidifed with the correct USB ProdID (0026), to get the power working.  It''s in the section "Getting WUSB54GS to Work in Edgy and Feisty''  Also check out the thread http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=2559643 here for why the script is needed and works.
 Other: With 2.6.16 and later kernels, RNDIS devices are not initialized (when device is plugged in, nothing happens). To get it going, you need to set the variable bConfigurationValue in sysfs. An easy way to do this is to add this: BUS==âusbâ, SYSFS{idProduct}==â0026â, SYSFS{idVendor}==â13b1â, PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/%p/device/bConfigurationValue''" to /etc/udev/rules.d/&lt;ruleFilename> file and restart udev. For FC6 &lt;ruleFilename> is 50-udev.rules.

 Driver: I got this working (with WPA-PSK CCMP/TKIP) effortlessly using the ndiswrapper/wpa_supplicant packages bundled on the Ubuntu 6.06 CD.  I used the Linksys WUSB54GPv4 1.02.00 driver release http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417109934&packedargs=sku%3D1115416827622&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper here which also includes the WUSB54GPv1 drivers in their own folder.  I have not checked if this driver is the same as the one in the seperate WUSB54GPv1 driver release; I just know it works.  Also, i had to blacklist the islsm modules (www.prism54.org) that ship with Ubuntu.

 Driver-and-Installation 
 *Option 1: Use a homegrown driver INF file that I have created, along with the same SYS file from above.  It has the benefit that you will not have to create any symlinks.  I''m hosting it for your convenience at http://ankhcraft.com/drivers/mn720-ankh.zip Please note that I do not provide any warranty for this INF file that I have created, express or implied. All I can say is that it works for me, and I''ve used this card heavily (with this driver).  
 *Option 2: Use Dell''s TrueMobile? 1300 driver. I''m hosting it for your convenience at http://ankhcraft.com/drivers/bcmwl5.zip Please note that the pciids are not the same for this card, so, following driver installation into ndiswrapper, you''ll need to create some symlinks, like so (as root): ln -s 14e4:4320:1028:0002.conf /etc/ndiswrapper/14e4:4325:1414:0003.conf ln -s 14e4:4325:1414:0003.conf /etc/ndiswrapper/14e4:4325.conf 
 *Option 3: Use Microsoft''s driver from the cd (or optionally from http://www.network-drivers.com/drivers/141/141400.htm) Please be warned that this driver does not play nice with Linux hosted NDIS emulation wrappers in general.  In order to get this driver work with ndiswrapper specifically, you must make sure you do NOT have the card plugged into the cardbus slot when you insert the ndiswrapper module. You''ll get a kernel panic if you do, and then you''re toast. Plug the card in afterward. After this, it works wonderfully. Also, it is worth mentioning that the Microsoft driver is known to be unstable when used with LinuxAnt''s driverloader. You may experience random system lockups, even though you may avoid the kernel panic mentioned above.  I would suggest that you stay away from this driver under Linux.  joe@ankhcraft.com - ankhcraft

 usbid: 0846:4220
 Driver: Netgear windows driver Version: Netgear, Inc.,03/03/2004, 1.0.8.4 from http://www.Netgear.com
 Other: Works well. To get the driver, use cabextract on the .exe, then unshield on the data1.cab. WPA-PSK TKIP worked with wpa-supplicant 0.2.4. Used kernel SuSE 2.6.5-7.104-default. The driver locked the machine when connected to an OHCI controller, but worked fine with EHCI, on a SiS 650 chipset. TCP throughput was apx 7Mbps, which is low, but CPU usage was not maxed out as it is under windows XP on test machine. ndiswrapper is CVS top of tree from 23rd August 2004. There is a native driver for Prism54 that is working on USB support. View its status at Prism54.org As same as you read above, but I use Fedora 3 with Kernel 2.6.11-14.  Use ndiswrapper version 1.1 from 5rd March 2005. I work with beta-driver from Netgear (WG111 SW1-2 Beta 13) in managed mode with no encryption. Encryction (WEP) doesn''t work on my machine (Gericom X5 Force) yet, but I am still working on it. Try to configure via system-config-network (the fedora gui) with hotplugd started, so you can plug in and work. Attention!!! don''t activate the item "active on boot" because hotplug doesn''t run at boot-time.

 Card: Netgear WG311v1
 Driver: v1.5 http://kbserver.Netgear.com/products/WG311v1.asp (I downloaded the windows drivers and installed them, then I extracted the netwg311.inf and the wg311nd5.sys files from the Program Files/Netgear directory)
 pciid: 168c:0013
 OS: Damn Small Linux 3.2 Kernel 2.4.26
 Other: Using ndiswrapper v1.8
 Other: WEP works just fine - I used the Ndiswrapper tool in the DSL panel using the following settings: directory = whatever directory you put the .inf and .sys files in, device = ath0, sid = whatever the name of your network is, key = whatever your WEP key is (it''s the long hexidecimal one, not the user define password.)

 Driver: Netgear windows driver Version: Netgear, Inc.,10/05/2004, 2.1 from http://www.Netgear.com or shipped with the setup CD. To get the driver, unzip it. The ndis drivers are in the ndis directory. Used kernel  Running Slackware v10.1 (kernel 2.6.10) ndiswrapper ver 1.1rc3 . There is a native driver for Prism54 that is working on USB support. View its status at http://www.prism54.org Prism54.org
 Other: With the driver for Sitecom WL-142, this device supports WPA2, keeps the device "alive" (with driver from Netgear, device stops working after a while) and correct some connection problem : http://www.sitecom.com/showdownload.php?id=1928.  Note that the device ID for Sitecom is different, so you need to create alias for it for WG111, e.g., with "ndiswrapper -d 0846:4240 wlanuig'', after which "ndiswrapper -l'' should show "hardware present''.
 Other: Works nearly well (several daily crashes in Summer 2005).
 Distro-specific: Debian Sarge 2.6.8.1, Ndiswrapper 0.10 Distro-specific: Debian Sid      2.6.8.X, Ndiswrapper 0.12+1.0rc2-1, without rfmon
 Other project without ndiswrapper : http://jbnote.free.fr/prism54usb/ (seems incomplete in january 2006 - not supporting WEP or WPA).

 Distro: Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, kernel 2.6.15-25
 Driver: (BAD) Realtek RTL8187L Win98SE/WinME driver v 1.221 from http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloads1-3.aspx?Keyword=RTL8187 - DriverVer 5.1221.0412.2006. Uses name netrtuw.inf. This works for a while, but after ~5 minutes of ssh/file copy traffic, the machine hung and had to be rebooted (reproducibly).
 Driver: (BAD) Netgear wg111v2 1.40 (?) from http://kbserver.Netgear.com/release_notes/D102948.asp (labeled as 2.00 on http://kbserver.Netgear.com/products/wg111v2.asp) - DriverVer 5.1213.06.0327. Ndiswrapper will load this driver successfully and find the device, but iwlist scans will fail and the device won''t associate.
 Other: MUST rmmod, or blacklist kernel driver r8187 (in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist) - it will claim the device before ndiswrapper gets a chance. The r8187 driver will associate with an AP and appear to work, but won''t actually transmit any data.

 Other: The XP drivers did not work in this package, but the WIN98 ones did.  In my experience, any driver for this adapter will load fine in ndiswrapper, but so far this is the only one that I got to find my AP.  Other drivers even detected other AP''s, but not mine (which was closer than the detected ones).  I also could not set the ESSID with other drivers. This one has neither of those problems.

 usbid: 0846:6a00 Netgear, Inc. WG111 WiFi (v2)
 Kernel: 2.6.20-16-generic This kernel comes with ndiswrapper module in place so I had to delete it. You can find the module with "locate ndiswrapper.ko''
 Distro: Ubuntu Feisty Fawn
 Driver download from: http://kbserver.Netgear.com/release_notes/d103125.asp
 Driver link: ftp://downloads.Netgear.com/files/wg111v2_3_3_0_setup.zip
 Installation: Used unzip to extract the setup program and then wine (NOTE: set winecfg | win98) to install the utilities that places the driver into ~.wine/drive_c/Programfiler/Netgear/WG111v2/Driver/Win98Me . Setting wine to win98 gives me win98 drivers. I tried the winXP drivers without success.
 Driver version: driver net111v2 (Netgear Inc.,02/07/2007,5.1283.0207.2007)
 WINXP driver does not work although it installs fine and also discovers some networks while scanning with "iwlist scan''. 
 ndiswrapper version: Installed ndiswrapper from svn sources, revision 2427. Older versions of this driver did crash my system and freeze it completely when unloading the ndiswrapper module or when removing the USB wireless adapter. New version does not crash my system.

 Other: ndiswrapper snapshot as of 6th April 2006 (earlier versions don''t work reliably with SMP). Athlon 64 x2 in 32-bit mode (preempt=yes,smp=yes). Label says WG111v2, but it''s a WG111v1 as far as the Netgear website is concerned (the "v2" driver is presumably for the version with usbid 0846:6a00). Initialisation occasionally fails for no reason.

 Driver: Windows driver from Netgear website
 Other: Both athfmwdl.inf and netwg11t.inf installed with ndiswrapper version 1.23 or later as there is a bug in previous versions of ndiswrapper (per the changelog).  This bug caused me hours of frustration using ndiswrapper v1.22 (Ubuntu Edgy).  If using vista compatible drivers (e.g. version 2.1) you will need to use wine (tested with version 0.9.49) to extract drivers and install netwg11t.inf from the Driver directory (only need one .inf) within "~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/NETGEAR/WG111T".  Version 2.1 also allows WPA2 to work.

 Other: The outside packaging has the label WG111NA, but the label on the shell of the device has "FCC ID: PY3WG111V2".  Maybe the chipset is same as other WG111 on this list, how to confirm?.  I''ve experienced a system lockup when removing the device from the usb port or when "deactivating'' the interface in the Fedora internet config tool; I have not yet isolated the problem because system behaves OK if it is shutdown before removing the device (and I''m lazy and complacent).  This usb card did not run at all with ndiswrapper 1.0.

 Driver: I got mine from the t-mobile CD that came with it (mine is a "customized card'', basically meaning they slapped a t-mobile sticker on it). I have been looking for a way to download these drivers, but this is apparently not possible. I had to install the software on a windows box, then have it install the "Option PC Cards driver selection'' package. From that I got the files http://www.metro.cx/gtfp/gtnwlan.inf gtnwlan.inf and http://www.metro.cx/gtfp/mrvw125.sys mrvw125.sys. You can install those with "ndiswrapper -i gtnwlan.inf''

 pciid: 14e4:4318
 Driver: I could not extract the USR driver so I used BCMWL5a.inf driver from Acer Aspire 5002. Currently tested successfully without encryption on Suse 10 using Suse provided ndiswrapper package
 Driver: I, on the other hand, was able to extract the USR driver from the CD. Run usrsetup.exe through Wine and it''ll give you a couple of .cab files you can use (the installer itself will fail). I chose to install USRMAXG.inf, but I think USRMAXGa.inf would work just as well. Works just fine. Gentoo Linux, 2.6.14 kernel, ndiswrapper 1.5 from Portage.
 WPA(2)-PSK works with both USRMAXGa.inf and BCMWL5a.inf using wpa_supplicant-0.4.8 (ndiswrapper-1.2,vanilla-2.6.13 Slackware 10.2/Suse 9.3)
 Driver: I was able to extract ALL of the above listed drivers by going to: http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5411 - and extracting the "5411-na-1.00.022.exe" file using WinXP. A "US Robotics" directory is created under C:\Program Files. All of the Drivers and INF files are in the "MAXg Sure Start Installer" directory. USRMAXGa.inf works on 2.4.22 Slackware 10.1 (But "times out" when not in use for several minutes).

 Other: Works perfect, also the radio, tested on Ubuntu 5.10 kernel 2.6.12, ndiswrapper 1.1-4ubuntu. Tested on openSuSE 10.0 & 10.1 ndiswrapper 1.23 (default ndiswrapper woks also in 10.1). if uper kernel than 2.6.13-15 it should works. It works with kernel >= 2.6.19 vanilla and ndiswrapper 1.30.
 Bug: If the usb adapter is disconnected before the system shutdown the computer freeze, probably kernel panic. no problem under openSuSE 10.1, under openSuSE 10.0 the card have to be configured under Yast. it could be remove at any time. If ndiswrapper eat all cpu and you are unabled to remove the module, please install the lastest windows driver.

 Chipset:Unknown
 usbid: 0baf:011B
 Driver: Official U.S. Robotics http://www.usr.com/support/5421/5421-files/5421-na.exe. Unpack it and install driver with USR5421X.inf. This doesn''t copy the .sys files (.sys files for RNDIS driver are part of Windows, so they are not needed in Windows; however, driver for USR5421 distributes .sys files but they are not installed by .inf file); so copy RNDISMPK.sys and usb8023k.sys files into /etc/ndiswrapper/usr5421x directory as rndismpk.sys and usb8023k.sys respectively).
 Other: Works with snapshot of 2006-02-13.
 Other: With 2.6.16 and later kernels, RNDIS devices are not initialized (when device is plugged in, nothing happens). To get it going, you need to set the variable bConfigurationValue in sysfs. An easy way to do this is to add 
  BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="001b", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0baf", \
  PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/%p/device/bConfigurationValue''" 
  to /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_local_rules file and restart udev. Replace idProduct and idVendor as appropriate; for USR5421, "lsusb'' shows 001b (idProduct) and 0baf (idVendor).
