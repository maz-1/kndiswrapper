This is a port from my old kndiswrapper app version 3.9.
The old app was build for the KDE Desktop Version 3.5.x 
and the old QtLibs.
The new app changed from autoconf to qmake and uses the 
new QtLibs.
Feel free to test the application and send any comment
to my eMail adress (joerg.zopes@linux-specialist.com)
The networkconfiguration can be done through the Net
Config menu provided by the application but I recommend
that you do the actual network configuration with
throught YaST or what network tool your disto uses.

Have a nice Linux-day.
